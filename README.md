### Project Description
The most useless but beautifully designed virtual kitchen where you can cook gorgeous virtual food that you'll never be able to eat!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People can already cook in real kitchens‚Ä¶ but tragically, they lack a way to waste time making fake meals they can‚Äôt eat.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a fully interactive virtual kitchen that lets you choose, fry, and plate imaginary food‚Äîperfect for anyone who wants all the effort of cooking with none of the edible results.
